# Unlocking Consumer Patterns for CredPal’s Credit Ecosystem

## Project Overview

This project leverages **Predictive Analytics** and descriptive data analysis to explore global consumer patterns, specifically tailored for **CredPal’s** credit-driven retail expansion. By analyzing the relationship between income, expenditure, and savings across various regions, this study identifies high-potential markets where on-demand consumer credit can thrive.

The analysis was performed using **Tableau** to visualize key financial metrics and consumer behavior across seven global regions.

## Key Business Questions

* Which regions demonstrate the strongest earning potential and repayment capacity? 


* What are the dominant spending categories that should drive credit product offerings? 


* How do savings rates correlate with income levels to signal financial discipline?

## Data Insights & Findings

### 1. Regional Financial Performance

* 
**Sub-Saharan Africa & Europe** are the leading markets, recording the highest average monthly incomes ($34.7M and $34.3M respectively).


* These regions also exhibit the highest **savings rates** (Sub-Saharan Africa at 26.10% and Europe at 25.86%), indicating strong financial discipline and repayment capacity.


* 
**North America** shows the lowest scalability for credit, with a low savings rate of 2.17%.



### 2. Consumer Expenditure & Preferences

* 
**Necessity-Driven Consumption:** Office Supplies ($5.7M) and Household Products ($5.4M) dominate regional budgets, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.


* 
**High Engagement Categories:** Personal Care, Clothes, and Cosmetics show the highest consumer preference counts, particularly in Africa and Europe, each exceeding 10,700 counts.


* 
**Low Priority Markets:** Categories like Fruits and Beverages record minimal spending, suggesting they are underdeveloped for credit intervention.



### 3. Financial Correlation

A strong **positive relationship** exists between income and expenditure; as income increases, spending rises. However, the analysis highlights that regions with higher income levels also maintain higher savings, reinforcing their status as "low-risk, high-growth" markets.
